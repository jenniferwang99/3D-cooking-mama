This Github project contains the Unity game produced for our 6.835 final project.

The main game is in 'Leap Motion Test'. The two other folders, 'Models' and 'Prefabs' are backup folders.

## Requirements
* Unity (requires to be run on Windows)
* Blender
* Leap Motion Sensor

## How to Run
To run, place the "Leap Motion Test" folder into Unity Hub. When it is done compiling, you can open it.

## Code (within `Leap Motion Test`)
The bulk of our code is in the `Assets` folder. Everything else came with the Unity Leap Motion Library we downloaded.
* `Assets`: contains all of our models, prefabs, scenes, and scripts
    * `Models` : all of our blender models. Can be opened in Blender 
    * `Prefabs` : all of our models as prefabs, with their own components/colliders
    * `Scripts` : the scripts we applied to our prefabs in our project
    * `Scenes` : the different scenes of our game. The beginning of our game is in `MainMenu`.
